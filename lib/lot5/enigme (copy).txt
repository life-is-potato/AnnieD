I am invisible yet powerful. And humans are blind to my ways. I seep into the earth and the air, and i change the world day by day. What am I ? Pollution Ghost Light Future
I am a concept that is new, Yet ancient in what I persue. I seek to balance nature and growth, Ensuring that both may boastn I strive for progress that is sustainable, And outcomes that are always obtainable. What am I ? Responsible Consumption Climate Action Peace and Justice Sustainable Development
I am a destination yet unknown, A place that has yet to be shown, I hold the possibility of change, But what will happen is hard to arrange. What am I ? Space Future Dream Area51
